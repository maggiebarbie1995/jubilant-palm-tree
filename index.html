                    <li>He disguised himself in various ways: by smearing ashes and charcoal over his body; wearing a cone-shaped cap made of dried banana leaves decorated with feathers; wearing an abandoned old cloak of an old man</li> 
                    <li>Wearing ostentatious ornaments around his neck and on his ears as worn by elderly men; and carrying the abandoned old hand-bag of an old man. As the boys went round</li>
